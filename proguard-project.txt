# This increases the size of the .apk by ~800kb, which is clearly
# undesirable. However, the nature of the Java security suite 
# implementations are that they use a lot of reflection to instantiate
# classes. The end result is that proguard excludes classes which 
# may be required, depending on the security algorithms required
# by certain certificates.

# There is a bug where the android.support.widget.SearchView gets
# removed by proguard which causes breakage. This prevents that
# from occuring by a bit of a brute force approach. While it would
# be possible to keep only the class in question, this may leave
# us open to other bugs in the future. Better to be safe than sorry.
